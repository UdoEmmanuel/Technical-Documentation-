                    <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
                        It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but 
                        effective approach to object-oriented programming.
                        Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its 
                        interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and 
                        rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely 
                        available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python 
                        web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same 
                        site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, 
                        programs and tools, and additional documentation.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

                            This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

                        Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:

                        The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended): 
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        words = [<span class="blue-strings">'cat'</span>, <span class="blue-strings">'window'</span>, <span class="blue-strings">'defenstrate'</span>]
                        <span class="red-codes">for</span> w in words:
                            print(w, len(w))
                        >>>
                        >>>
                        cat 3
                        window 6
                        defenestrate 12
                    </code>
                    <p>Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:</p>

                    <p>
                        We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary:
                    </p>

                            print(a, end=' ')
                            a, b = b, a+b
                        print()
                        >>>
                        fib(2000)
                        >>>

                    <p>The keyword def introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the 
                        parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at
                         the next line, and must be indented.
                    </p>              
                    <P>A function definition associates the function name with the function object in the current symbol table. 
                        The interpreter recognizes the object pointed to by that name as a user-defined function. Other names can
                         also point to that same function object and can also be used to access the function:

                    <p>
                        The break statement breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop.
                        A for or while loop can include an else clause.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a for loop, the else clause is executed after the loop reaches its final iteration.
                        In a while loop, it’s executed after the loop’s condition becomes false.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In either kind of loop, the else clause is not executed if the loop was terminated by a break.
                        This is exemplified in the following for loop, which searches for prime numbers:
                    </p>

                        <span class="red-codes">for</span> x in range(2, n):

                        2 is a prime number
                        3 is a prime number

                        5 is a prime number
                        6 equals 2 * 3
                        7 is a prime number
                        8 equals 2 * 4
                        9 equals 3 * 3
                    </code>
                    <p>When used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try statement
                         than it does with that of if statements: a try statement’s else clause runs when no exception occurs, 
                         and a loop’s else clause runs when no break occurs.
